When Cameron Snider was living in Europe like a dirty heathen, he used to frequent a popular Mexican restaurant. It was actually really good food. It's quite a shame that it closed down a few years ago. I'd love to go back. I think I left a Google review on the restaurant next door that is still up.

## Writeup
1. This one is just finding what country I lived in (not hard). 
2. Next, you can just search for Mexican restaurants in the city of Olomouc that have closed in the last few years. 
3. Finally, search through the google reviews of the cafe literally next door, and mine should be at the top with the flag.
