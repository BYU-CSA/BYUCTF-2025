# Czech This Out
Description:
```markdown
When Cameron Snider was a young man, he lived in a foreign country with his dad. As it turns out, some of Europe is actually not that bad. He had a blog when he was there. Can you find it?

## Writeup
1. Ok, so at this point it should be pretty clear that the country in question was the Czech Republic. 
2. Doing some research, we can find that Cameron was a child when he lived here. This tells us that it is likely not some hand-coded blog, but some generic blog service like Blogspot or Wordpress. 
3. A simple google search like “Cameron in Czech WordPress blog” brings us right to the blog in question.
