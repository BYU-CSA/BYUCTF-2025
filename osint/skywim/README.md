One time I tried to take a screenshot of my Skyrim character next to my favorite NPC (who doesnâ€™t love goth girls). I decided to AFK for a second to heat up some soup. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected enemies up here, and I died. My last save was like 4 hours before this picture was taken, and I never remembered where I captured this beautiful sight. Can you help me find the name of the location where this picture was taken in Skyrim?

This is a real, named location in Skyrim. You do not need to own or play the game to solve this challenge, though it could be helpful.

## Writeup
1. On the left side of the image you can see a boat in the water, with some kind of large arch behind it. If you look at a few pictures of skyrim locations, you will learn that is the city of Solitude.
2. Looking in front of the boat, we see a single bridge. Also, the picture is taken on some sort of hill or something.
3. Going to an interactive Skyrim map like (https://mapgenie.io/skyrim/maps/skyrim), we can find the boat in the water, the single bridge, and a cliff. That cliff houses the location "Dragon Bridge Overlook", where the image was taken from.
